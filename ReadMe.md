<h1>Python Guessing Game</h1>
    <p1>
        This project was fun to make. It is a guessing game that lets a player play against a computer or another human player.

<h2>How I tested the Code</h2>

    I uploaded the file to a slack channel for coworkers to play and test. I also created a mural retrospective activity which i used to make the project better.
